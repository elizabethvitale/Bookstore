        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p> From the #1 New York Times bestselling author, a thrilling and
          addictive new novel—a prequel to The Pillars of the Earth—set in
          England at the dawn of a new era: the Middle Ages
          <br>
          It is 997 CE, the end of the Dark Ages. England is facing attacks
          from the Welsh in the west and the Vikings in the east. Those in power
          bend justice according to their will, regardless of ordinary people
          and often in conflict with the king. Without a clear rule of law,
          chaos reigns.

          In these turbulent times, three characters find their lives
          intertwined. A young boatbuilder's life is turned upside down when the
          only home he's ever known is raided by Vikings, forcing him and his
          family to move and start their lives anew in a small hamlet where he
          does not fit in. . . . A Norman noblewoman marries for love,
          following her husband across the sea to a new land, but the customs
          of her husband's homeland are shockingly different, and as she
          begins to realize that everyone around her is engaged in a constant,
          brutal battle for power, it becomes clear that a single misstep
          could be catastrophic. . . . A monk dreams of transforming his
          humble abbey into a center of learning that will be admired
          throughout Europe. And each in turn comes into dangerous
          conflict with a clever and ruthless bishop who will do anything to
          increase his wealth and power.

          Thirty years ago, Ken Follett published his most popular novel,
          The Pillars of the Earth. Now, Follett's masterful new prequel
          The Evening and the Morning takes us on an epic journey into a
          historical past rich with ambition and rivalry, death and birth, love
          and hate, that will end where The Pillars of the Earth begins.</p>
